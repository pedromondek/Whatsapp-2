# ‚ú® Features 

### Home Page / Login & Sign Up Page
- When we initially enter the website, we have a welcome page followed by a small login or registration inputs.

<br>

### Landing Page
- When you log in, on the right-hand side, you'll find instructions on how to start a new or previously created chat. 
- And on the left-hand side, you'll find the user's initiated chats, updated in real time.

<br>

### Change your Account (Username, Password & Profile Image) / Delete Account
- In the upper left corner, you'll find the user's profile, which can be accessed to access account change options, such as username, password, and profile picture.
- This also provides access to the option to delete your account.

<br>

### Search User
- By following the steps to start a conversation, the user is taken to a user search area by Username, where they can find other users and start a conversation. 
- The conversation only starts when the user sends the message; if they don't, the chat between users isn't created.

<br>

### Chatting
- Once a conversation is created, both users can communicate in real time within the same chat.
- Notifications are also tracked, so if a user logs out or leaves the site, they can receive their unread messages when they visit the site again.
- Users can also see each other's status (online/offline).
- If a conversation is deleted by one of the participants, the chat ends. 
- The user's chat status will change to "Conversation Closed by ${username}" and will be available to the other user only in view mode. This will require a new chat.
- The same occurs when a user deletes their own account, with the difference being that the status message indicates that the user has deleted their account.
Each user can only have one active chat per user.
